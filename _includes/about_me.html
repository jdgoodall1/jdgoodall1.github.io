                    I have over 5 years of experience in IT, across most of the SDLC - 1 year business & systems analysis, 1 year testing (manual and automation), 3 years release and environment management, 2 years DevOps). However I have found my niche in DevOps and automation.

                    I love automation. If you've had to do a task once, you'll have to do it again. I love being able to take a repetitive, time consuming task and make sure that no-one ever has to look at it again, and with my background in environments management, I'm
                    able to apply this right down to the server level (specifically monitoring and health), with real-time alerting and fault-tolerant scripting.
