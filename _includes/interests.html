                My personal interests include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Home Automation</b>. I've been interested in home automation - and particularly the challenges around securing the IoT - for a long time. The devices are now almost ubiquitos, but I still don't think anyone has entirely covered
                    the security element.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Coding</b>. Somewhat unsurprising for an engineer, but I constantly have a number of different web courses "on-the-go", to widen my skills. Currently working through Python 2 & Python 3, Groovy (to be used as past of a Jenkins Shared
                    Library), and Kotlin (for Team City Build Chains).
